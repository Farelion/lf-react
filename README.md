#### Idea:
Refresh old project https://github.com/Farelion/lf but in react. </br>

Project is web-app for World of Warcraft game, that helps you find where you can drop item with certain criteria, so you don't have to check every dungeon in journal.</br>


### Database file creator https://github.com/Farelion/lf-db-creator



### Todo:
- rwd
- get all categories and make buttons for them
- hide dungeon if no items inside
